# DocWorld
A mod of combined patches for my RimWorld mod collection [The Doctor's World](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1568763074). There are a lot of patches done to the various mods outlined in the "Changelog" in the "About" folder. I suggest you read there for detailed information. For a brief overview, the "Patches" folder has every patch named after the two mods/categories that are modified.

The basics are: mod moves items to new tabs and organizes layout, balances some recipes for various items, enhances minaturisation abilities, improves inter-mod compatability.
